                Sound Healing is usually offered as â€˜Gong Immersion or Gong Bath wherein you are bathed with the
                beautiful sounds and powerful vibrations of a gong and other sounds. With its unique meditative and
                therapeutic aspects, these vibrations bring healing sensations that stills the mind and soothes the
                soul. A gong immersion often includes the use of Tibetan/Himalayan singing bowls, Native American
                flutes, African or shamanic drums, hang drum, conch shell, chimes and tuning forks. It is a shortcut to
                bringing about a restive and restorative state to your whole being.
